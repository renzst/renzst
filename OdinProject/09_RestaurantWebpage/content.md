  - About
    - Picture
    - Just like our tagline, we offer free groceries at our store
    - We have been offering free groceries since March 2020
    - We didn't have a store at the beginning of the pandemic
    - Our store consisted of little mini stores delivered in bags where you couldn't choose
    - In May 2022 we started putting the store in Free Grocery Store (or perhaps the free groceries in the store)
    - Now our store helps 400 people
  - Waitlist Status

# Wurlcurm toer myr kitchern

Hi! My name is Renz and I use they/them pronouns. I'm currently a student of the University of Florida, studying GIS with anticipation of studying a Master's of Urban Planning.

I do a lot of work in food access - coding is just my pet project. Watch me fuck up immensely and constantly over and over again on my coding projects.

Some languages/frameworks/software I work with or hope* to work with:
  - R
  - Python
  - GIS
      - ArcGIS
      - QGIS
      - OpenLayers*
      - GeoServer*
  - Front-end
      - HTML
      - CSS (I really fuck with grids, looking forward to subgrids)
      - Javascript*
  - Back-end
      - Javascript*
      - SQL (I personally like Postgres)
      - React*
